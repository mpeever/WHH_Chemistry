\section{Overview}
This is an introductory Chemistry class. Our goal is to lay a solid foundation for studying ``hard" sciences\footnote{As opposed to social sciences like Sociology.} through high school and college. 

We'll keep Psalm 107:23--32 in mind as we begin to exploring chemistry together. Chemistry can feel a bit overwhelming, like being lost at sea, but those who take risks see the wonders of God.

Our goals for this course are:
\begin{itemize}
\item to cultivate a love of ``hard" sciences, especially chemistry,
\item to build good math habits, especially as they pertain to physical sciences, and
\item to build a good foundation of skills for problem-solving
\end{itemize}

\section{Prerequisites/Corequisites}
There will be some overlap with \textbf{Physical Science}, don't be discouraged if there's a lot of review to start!

We will use basic algebra a \emph{lot}. 
We'll go as far as logarithms for pH calculations.  
I plan to use class time to review/refresh math topics as we go, so don't let that scare you.
If you have finished \textbf{Algebra I}, you should be fine. 
If you haven't yet finished Algebra I \emph{but are willing to put in the effort}, you should be fine.

If you don't understand the math, you need to ask.

\section{Course Pace and Class Time}
There are 16 modules in the text book, so we will cover one module every two weeks, with some exceptions (see Table \ref{table:class-schedule}). \emph{Please plan to have read and/or worked through each module in preparation for class.}  We will review the module's material in the class, answering student questions as a priority. The pace might be a bit different from what you've done in the past, so give yourself some time to adjust.

At the end of each module are practice problems: I plan to assign every problem in the book as home-work. You have been warned.

We will have several quizzes through the class to ensure we're all up to date. At the end of each quarter there will be a take-home exam.

\section{Expectations}
This will be a math-heavy class. Come with a \textbf{scientific calculator}, a solid \textbf{three-ring binder}, plenty of \textbf{looseleaf paper}, \textbf{pencils} and plenty of \textbf{erasers}. 

I relish questions, especially questions that show you have been listening. Bring plenty of those.

\section{Meeting Times}
TRC Classroom 2       \\
8:55 A.M. -- 10:20 A.M. Fridays \\ 

\section{Topics}
I have included a weekly break-down of topics in Table \ref{table:class-schedule}.
We'll refine our schedule as we go: I anticipate some topics will take less time to cover than others.
