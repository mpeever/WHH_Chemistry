\section{Overview}
This is an introductory Chemistry class. Our goal is to lay a solid foundation for studying ``hard" sciences\footnote{As opposed to social sciences like Sociology.} through high school and college. 

We'll keep Psalm 107:23--32 in mind as we begin to exploring chemistry together. Chemistry can feel a bit overwhelming --- a bit like being lost at sea --- but those who take risks put themselves in a position to see the wonders of God.

Our goals for this course are:
\begin{itemize}
\item to cultivate a love of ``hard" sciences, especially chemistry,
\item to build good math habits, especially as they pertain to physical sciences, and
\item to build a good foundation of skills for problem-solving
\end{itemize}

\section{Prerequisites/Corequisites}
There will be some overlap with \textbf{Physical Science}, don't be discouraged if there's a lot of review to start!

We will use basic algebra a \emph{lot}. 
We'll go as far as logarithms towards the end of the year.  
I plan to use class time to review/refresh math topics as we go, so don't let that scare you.
If you have finished \textbf{Algebra I}, you should be fine. 
If you haven't yet finished Algebra I \emph{but are willing to put in the effort}, you should be fine.

If you don't understand the math, you need to ask.

\section{Course Pace and Class Time}
There are 16 modules in the text book, so we will cover one module every two weeks, with some exceptions (see Table \ref{table:class-schedule}). \emph{Please plan to have read and/or worked through each module in preparation for class.}  We will review the module's material in the class, answering student questions as a priority. If the module is split, then plan to have worked through the first half on the first week, the second half on the second. The pace might be a bit different from what you've done in the past, so give yourself some time to adjust.

At the end of each module are practice problems: I plan to have assigned every problem in the book eventually. You have been warned.

We will have several quizzes through the class to ensure we're all up to date. At the end of each quarter there will be a take-home exam.

There are several labs scheduled for this course. As much as possible, we'll do that labs as homework, but we'll dedicate some class time to learning how to write them up.
Some labs will require class time: we'll schedule those as we go.

\section{Expectations}
This will be a math-heavy class. Come with a \textbf{scientific calculator}, a sturdy \textbf{three-ring binder}, plenty of \textbf{looseleaf paper}, \textbf{pencils} and plenty of \textbf{erasers}. 

Please don't attempt to turn in any work written in ink: this will be a \textbf{pencil-only course}.\footnote{No one will get everything right the first time: you \emph{will} need to be able to erase your answers.}

I relish questions, especially questions that show you have been listening. Bring plenty of those.

\section{How to Study}
You don't study chemistry by reading, you study chemistry by solving problems.
If you don't have a pencil, eraser, and calculator, you're not studying chemistry.

Be aware this class requires your active participation.

\section{Grading}
The goal of grading is to ensure we're making progress as we move forward through chemistry. 

\section{Topic Schedule}
The schedule for the first quarter is given in Table \ref{table:class-schedule-q1}.
Please note I've included both labs and homework problems in the Q1 schedule.\footnote{We'll assume the labs are to be done at home and the results brought to class on the listed day. There will be labs to be done in class, but we'll plan on doing the labs at home to start.}

I have included a weekly break-down of topics for the whole year in Table \ref{table:class-schedule-year}.
We'll refine our schedule as we go: I anticipate some topics will take less time to cover than others.
