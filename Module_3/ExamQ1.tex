\begin{questions}
\question[5] Gideon has a shiny new calorimeter. He measures the temperature of the water in it and finds it measures  $25.0^{\circ}C$. What is the temperature of the water in Kelvin? 

\question[5] Am\'{e}lie measures the volume of water in Gideon's calorimeter and finds it to be $1.00 L$. What is the mass of the water in Gideon's calorimeter?

\question[5] Ella puts a $5.00 cm^3$ piece of \ce{Cu} (copper) into Gideon's calorimeter.  The density of copper is $8.96 \frac{g}{cm^{3}}$. What is the mass of the piece of copper?

\question[5] Nate notices that the temperature of the water has rises to $30.0^{\circ}C$ after Ella puts the copper into the calorimeter. How many Joules of thermal energy has the water absorbed?

\question[5] Avery thinks Joules are a silly unit of measure, so she converts Nate's thermal energy measurement into calories. How many calories of thermal energy did the water absorb?

\question[5] Jack looks up the specific heat of the calorimeter in the user's manual and finds that it's $0.5990 \frac{J}{g \cdot ^{\circ}C}$. How much thermal energy did the calorimeter absorb?

\question[5] Caroline, knowing Avery hates measuring energy in Joules, wants to record the thermal energy the calorimeter absorbed into calories. How many calories is that?

\question[5] Vianne realizes she forgot to record the initial temperature of Ella's piece of \ce{Cu}, but she knows she can calculate it easily. What was the original temperature of Ella's piece of copper?

\question[5] Thomas wants to record temperatures in Kelvin. What is the original temperature of the \ce{Cu} block in Kelvin?

\question[5] Ezra and No\'{e}mie dump out the calorimeter, draining the warm water into a bucket that already contains ice. After five minutes, they notice there is still ice floating in the water. What temperature would we expect the water and ice mixture to have? Explain your reasoning.

\bonusquestion \emph{Bonus Question} There are three men Scripture calls ``King of kings." Who are they?
